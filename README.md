Lambton - iOS Fundamentals

# To open the project

Once we have the Firebase installed, we need to open the project through the "FinalProject.xcworkspace" file, and not through "FinalProject.xcodeproj" anymore

# Pod install

On Terminal, inside the folder FinalProject, where we have the FinalProject.xcodeproj, FinalProject.xcworkspace, Podfile etc, run this line:

> pod install

---> It will create a folder called Pods in the folder of your project instance.
